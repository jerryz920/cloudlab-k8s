This folder contains real attestation values posted from kubernetes to MDS

each .sh file is a simple curl script that almost equals to what K8s did for an http request (minor differences in header/agent, etc)
each .json file is the request body in SAFE request format.

Naming convention:
req.<uuid>_pod.json is the main statement, which posts the pod as an instance, image field as the sha256 hash of its entire configuration spec.
req.<uuid>_global.json is the config set of the pod, including metadata information like output tag, user, pubkey hash.
req.<uuid>__<ctn_name>.json is the config set of a container with name <ctn_name> under pod <uuid>, it has all the cmdline args, environment variables, etc.
  note: a pod can have init containers, which are not specially treated. An example: req.026f48d4-3a68-42fd-b8b0-9c94f00b1f1a__spark-init.json
req.<uuid>_containers.json is the list of container names in a pod.
